Python concepts explained in different notebooks. 
Fork these notebooks to make your own seperate copies. Optin to fork is on the top right of your screen.
Go through them.. Those who don't have Anaconda installed (not telling you to install either for this purpose) open "colab.research.google.com" in your browser and upload these notebooks and go through them.
Try to go through all of the notebooks before this Wednesday( 03/07/2019). And then start doing coding practice from "codechef.com" or " hackerrank.com"
